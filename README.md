# dve - the distributed video encoder

This is a small script to do distributed, high quality video encoding.

The script:

- breaks input video into chunks.
- distributes chunks to different servers via SSH.
- encodes those chunks in parallel.
- reassembles the chunks into final encoded video.

Why do this? So you can encode video using the best settings possible,
and use as many machines as you have available to ensure it doesn't
take forever. ☺

## Usage

By default, dve will just use your local host for encoding, which isn't likely to
improve performance. At a bare minimum, you should specify more than one host
to encode with:

    dve -l host1,host2,host3 media/test.mp4

After the encoding is completed and the chunks stitched back together, you
should end up with an output file named something like "original_new.mkv" in
your current working directory. You can adjust output naming, but note that the
output container format will currently always be mkv:

    dve -s .encoded.mkv -l host1,host2,host3 media/test.mp4

Encoding currently breaks input videos into 1m (60s) chunks. This should give
reasonable parallelism across a reasonable number of hosts. If you have
many hosts you may need to adjust this down using -t. If you have a small number
of hosts and a long video, you may wish to bump this up to encode larger chunks
and get marginally better compression. Values larger than 300 (15m) are
probably a waste of time.

Since the ffmpeg situation in Ubuntu has been resolved, dve no longer
tries to copy over your local copy of ffmpeg for encoding, which greatly
simplifies the script logic. This means you need to have an ffmpeg binary on
every system used for encoding, and if you specify a custom path, that custom
path should be the same on every system.

## Benchmarks

Hosts used for this benchmark were dual Xeon L5520 systems with 24GB of RAM,
16 HT cores per host. Input video file is a 4k resolution (4096x2304) test
clip, 3:47 in length.

### ffmpeg on a single host

```bash
$ time nice -n 10 ./ffmpeg -y -v error -stats -i test.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 20.0 -preset medium -c:a libvorbis -aq 5 -f matroska test.mkv

```

### dve with 3 hosts

```bash
$ time dve -o "-c:v libx264 -crf 20.0 -preset medium -c:a libvorbis -aq 5" -l c1,c2,c3 test.mp4

### Summary

dve has overhead, due to breaking the source file into chunks, transferring those chunks
across the network, retrieving the encoded chunks, and recombining into a new file.

Given these limitations, a ~2x speed increase by using 3 encoding machines is
a reasonable improvement over using a single system.

If you've got benchmarks using more hosts, please submit them!

## Installation

### SSH

SSH is used by GNU parallel to distribute the jobs to target systems.
It's recommended that you use "ssh-keygen" and "ssh-copy-id" to
setup key based authentication to all your remote hosts.

The script does not prompt for passwords, as such it needs to log in automatically 
to each server. Test this by typing ```ssh host``` such as ```ssh 192.168.1.5``` if it drops you 
straight to a prompt, you are ready.
  

### Pre-reqs

The following need to be installed on each of the hosts running this script:

- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)

It's recommended that you use recent (>= 2.5.x) versions of ffmpeg to ensure
they have all the required functionality for splitting and combining the
video chunks.

### Test Results
On the main server running dual 2.4Ghz 6 core with 12Mb L3 cache running ffmpeg regular with the same switches as the script I get:
```bash
    time ffmpeg -i test.mkv  -c:v libx265 -pix_fmt yuv420p10le -preset fast -x265-params -c:a  new.mkv
    ffmpeg version 2.8.6-1ubuntu2 Copyright (c) 2000-2016 the FFmpeg developers
    encoded 52846 frames in 912.04s (57.94 fps), 195.18 kb/s, Avg QP:33.87
    real    15m13.523s
    user    94m48.804s
    sys     1m18.776s
```
    
I tried it using dve on 5 servers, all with decent processors and ram (more than 32GB per server). It never kicked off the 5th server, but it still did much better with these results:
```bash
    time dve -l 127.0.0.1,192.168.1.25,192.168.1.151,192.168.1.230,192.168.1.252 test.mkv
    real    6m45.075s
    user    0m13.552s
    sys     0m1.288s
```

You don't get the cumulative fps like you do when you run ffmpeg directly because the job was broken into several pieces. On some of those I might see 100fps, on others 50fps, but all coming from the same source file.
### Windows

dve can be run on Windows via [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/).

To do so, you'll need to:

- build GNU parallel manually from source (requires make).
- install a static build of [ffmpeg for Windows](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/).
- install (or symlink) above into your $PATH, usually ~/bin.

You'll also need to do the following if you want to use the host to render with:

- [configure sshd](http://www.noah.org/ssh/cygwin-sshd.html)
- alter ~/.bashrc as mentioned above.

## Restrictions

- currently only generates mkv containers on output.
